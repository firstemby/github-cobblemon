/**
 * A range of moon phases for a world mainly to be used in [SpawningCondition]s. A moon phase range
 * is defined as any number of phase integer ranges (0-7).
 *
 * There are a series of in-built moon phase ranges that you can replace if they don't suit
 * your definitions.
 *
 * If you want a moon phase range to be referenced by name in [SpawningCondition]s, you need
 * to register it, by name, in [moonPhaseRanges].
